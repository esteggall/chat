#### Basic Client/Server Chat (Python) ####
This code provides a basic chat platform modeled loosely after IRC.
The clients are allowed to chat amongst one another, as well as 
create and join separate channels.

## Starting up clients/server ##
# Usage:
# Start server
python chat_srv.py

# Two or more chat clients can be started 
python chat_cli.py [host] [port]
# Example
python chat_cli.py localhost 9009

## Chatting ##

After the clients are started they can type messages back
and forth. Lines beginning with the '/' character are used
for administrative purposes as described below.

## Chat Options ##

Once a client has been started there are 6 options; 
create new channel, join channel, list available channels,
list users in current channel, and exit channel.

/c channel_name - (c)reate channel "channel_name"                        
/j channel_name - (j)oin channel "channel_name"                          
/l - (l)ist channels" 
/u - list (u)sers in current channel"                                    
/x - e(x)it channel, this option returns you Home
